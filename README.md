# Welcome

ðŸ‘‹ **Hi, I'm Sharon!**

Welcome to my personal website. Here you will find some of the projects that I have completed through my university course, projects from work and some of my hobby/ learner projects.

I am fascinated by the possibility of data and I want to use data to help make the world a better place.

# Project List:

### [Predict cancer patients survival rate using Machine Learning](https://github.com/sharonymtan/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/bikeshare-dataset-data-preprocessing)

- University coursework project
- Created two classification models using Python to predict if a patient will survive more than or less than five years post surgery.
- K-Nearest-Neighbour algorithm and Decision Tree Learning Model.
- Performance measured using confusion matrix.

- University coursework project
- Preprocessed real life dataset on bikeshare activity provided by the Capital Bikeshare, available here at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset?select=hour.csv). The purpose of this task is to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Applied Tidy principles.
- Performed data cleaning, data manipulation and transformation

- Self learn project
- Explored covid data sourced from ['Our World in Data'](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), collected on 23 December 2021.
- Looked at top level covid numbers by continent and global.
- Visualised data using Tableau Public.
