## Welcome

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I am a data science student based in Sydney, currently enrolled in the Master of Data Science program with UNSW and I am due to graduate by early 2023. I am also working full time at the moment as a Finance Manager at an advertising agency, and I am looking to transition into the field of data science.

Here you will find some of projects that I have completed through my university courses and some of the data analysis that I worked or still working on in my current company.
