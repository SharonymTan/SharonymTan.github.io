## Welcome

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sharon!

Master of Data Science student from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), due to graduate early 2023.

Welcome to my personal website. Here you will find some of the projects that I have completed through my university course, projects from work and some of my hobby/ learner projects.

I am fascinated by the possibility of data and I want to use data to help the world a better place.

## Project List:

### [Predict cancer patients survival rate using Machine Learning](https://github.com/sharonymtan/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/bikeshare-dataset-data-preprocessing)

![Image](/images/marcelo-leal-unsplash.jpg)
- University assessment completed at RMIT Univesity.
- Created two classification models using Python to predict if a patient will survive more than or less than five years post surgery.
- Used the Habermanâ€™s Survival Data Set sourced from the [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/haberman's+survival).
- K-Nearest-Neighbour algorithm and Decision Tree Learning Model.
- Performance measured using confusion matrix.
- A complete written report can also be found in the [Github repo](https://github.com/sharonymtan/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/predicting-patient-survival-rate)

- University assessment completed at RMIT Univesity.
- Preprocessed real life dataset on bikeshare activity provided by the Capital Bikeshare, available here at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset?select=hour.csv). The purpose of this task is to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Applied Tidy principles.
- Performed data cleaning and data manipulation.
- Scanned for missing values and outliers.
- Applied log transformations during data exploration.

### [Data Exploration with SQL and Visualisation using Tableau](https://github.com/sharonymtan/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/covid-dataset-sql-project)
![Image](/images/covid-tableau-dashboard.png)
- Explored covid data sourced from ['Our World in Data'](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
- Looked at top level covid numbers by continent and global
- Visualised data using Tableau Public
