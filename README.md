# Welcome

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Sharon.

Master of Data Science student from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), due to graduate early 2023.

Welcome to my personal website. Here you will find some of the projects that I have completed through my university course, projects from work and some of my hobby projects.

I am fascinated by the world of data and I am passionate about using data to solve problems that are important in our world. 

# Project List:

## [Predict breast cancer patients' survival rate using Machine Learning](https://github.com/sharonymtan/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/bikeshare-dataset-data-preprocessing)

![Image](/images/marcelo-leal-unsplash.jpg)
- University assessment completed at RMIT Univesity.
- Created two classification models using Python to predict if a patient will survive more than or less than five years post surgery.
- Used the Habermanâ€™s Survival Data Set sourced from the [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/haberman's+survival).
- K-Nearest-Neighbour algorithm and Decision Tree Learning Model.
- Performance measured using confusion matrix.
- A complete written report can also be found in the [Github repo](https://github.com/sharonymtan/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/predicting-patient-survival-rate)

## [Data preprocessing with Bikeshare dataset with R](https://github.com/sharonymtan/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/bikeshare-dataset-data-preprocessing)
![Image](/images/bikesharing-image.jpg)
- University assessment completed at RMIT Univesity.
- Preprocessed real life dataset on bikeshare activity provided by the Capital Bikeshare, available here at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset?select=hour.csv). The purpose of this task is to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Applied Tidy principles.
- Performed data cleaning and data manipulation.
- Scanned for missing values and outliers.
- Applied log transformations during data exploration.
